## Description

Last Groomed is an offline based software that keeps the event date of 5 different events on separate calendars that we often perform to keep us clean and look good so that we can keep a track when we cut our hair or clip our nails or shave. The 5 categories of events are as follows:

    * Haircut
    * Shave
    * Nails
    * Armpit
    * Pubes

There are 5 different sections in the app with 5 different specific calendars categorizing by the above categories where you can mark when did you groom yourself according to those categories. You can keep multiple events on a category to keep a track when did you shave or cut your hair. It is like a calendar where you keep your track whenever you perform any above task.

The shave category is customized according to gender for obvious reasons assuming males will shave their beard and females will shave their body or leg hair.

Last Groomed app is highly focused on interactive user interface (UI) so that users can connect and feel the app and gets himself or herself inspired to clean or rather groom themselves. The app comes with 2 different color scheme according to gender:

    * Male - Amber
    * Female - Pink

Last Groomed app also categorizes the theme mode in 2 differnet and very popular categories according to the device's pereferred brightness:

    * Light mode
    * Dark mode

With fluid UI and seemless animations the usage of the app is to keep tracks of the haircut, shave & etc. dates took place in your life so that you can keep track and plan in advance when to cut your hair or to easily recall when did you clean your pubes last time.

## How to Use

Last Groomed app is made the user in mind to make it more interactive and easy to use. Though the app itself looks very ordinary and simple but rest assure that a lot of functionalities are handled in the background so that users get a seemless interactive user experience and get motivated to groom themselves to keep themselves tidy and fresh even if they are going through hard times in their lives. We can all use a little tool to treat us sometimes, don't we?

To keep a record on which date you did your haircut or shave, just go to that specific category and tap on the date that you want to mark. To unmark, just tap the date again.

## Technical

Last Groomed project is based on Flutter framework and it is created with Dart 3 compatibility. 

#### Platform
The project is made for all the platforms like Android, iOS, Web, Linux, MacOS and Windows. However, currenty the android version is in production which is available in Google Play Store. 

#### Database
Since, Last Groomed is an offline app, we used Hive local no sql database to store all the event records inside user's device to get a fast and seemless experience by the user and also keeping the data safety issue in mind. Also, not to mention, the popular Shared Preferences package is also used in this system to keep gender and theme mode preference data locally.

#### State Management
Last Groomed project consists of both Provider and BLoC Pattern state management systems to make the app highly optimal and provide a fluid seemless comfortable and enthusiasing user interaction experience so that user gets motivated to use the app over and over again so that they can enjoy cleaning and tiding themselves and shake down all the hardship from their body and life, philosophically.

#### Dart DevTools
Last Groomed app is optimized using Dart DevTools and Inspect Widgets, CPU, Performance & Memory section do fall in the optimization category of this app. Only initial jank cannot be optimized using precompiled shader since according to Android Devs because of the high range of GPUs in Adroid devices it is not optimal to precache the shader. So a short jank will occur at the initialization of the Last Groomed Android app.
